# Data Analysis Project: Cobra Blue Inc.

## Overview:
As a Junior BI Analyst, I participated in the development of a Business Intelligence (BI) solution for Cobra Blue Inc., one of the largest electronics companies in Brazil. The project, named **BLUEUP**, aimed to implement a corporate BI solution that optimized strategic decision-making by providing detailed insights into sales, inventory, and regional performance, as well as guiding expansion strategies.

## Project Objectives:
- Develop a centralized **Data Warehouse** to support reliable and real-time analysis.
- Create transactional and dimensional models, using best practices in data modeling.
- Automate report generation, replacing manual Excel processes.
- Implement **interactive dashboards** to visualize strategic KPIs and performance analysis.

## My Contributions to the Project:

### Data Modeling:
I participated in creating the logical dimensional model, structured based on the **Star Schema**. The model included:
- Fact tables, such as `fato_venda`, which consolidate transactional sales data.
- Dimension tables, such as `dim_cliente`, `dim_produto`, `dim_localidade`, and `dim_tempo`, to support detailed and segmented analysis.

After defining the logical model, I implemented the physical model in the **MySQL** DBMS, setting up tables, indexes, and relationships necessary to ensure data performance and integrity.

### ETL and Data Integration:
- Assisted in setting up **ETL** (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to integrate data from different sources into the **Data Warehouse**.
- Ensured data consistency and proper configuration of relationships between tables in the physical model.

### Power BI Dashboard Development:
- Collaborated on the design and creation of interactive dashboards in **Power BI**, allowing the visualization of key indicators such as:
  - Sales by region and product categories.
  - Identification of less profitable categories and analysis of the impact of bundles/packages.
- Worked on customizing the visualizations to make data interpretation easier for regional directors and the CEO.

### Results Analysis:
- Contributed to analyzing the insights generated, highlighting product categories with low profit margins and opportunities for strategic adjustments in the portfolio.
- Helped demonstrate the impact of report automation in reducing errors and increasing operational efficiency.

## Tools and Technologies Used:
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and analysis.
- **MySQL**: For data manipulation and implementing the physical model.
- **DB Schema**: For creating and documenting transactional and dimensional models.

## Learnings and Impact:
During this project, I gained practical experience in data modeling, ETL processes, and creating visualizations in Power BI. As a **Junior BI Analyst**, this work was essential in reinforcing my technical skills and understanding how BI solutions can positively impact a company's operations and strategy.
