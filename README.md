# Project_BLUEUP
 As a Junior BI Analyst, I contributed to the BLUEUP project for Cobra Blue Inc., developing a Business Intelligence solution. The process involved creating a dimensional model based on the Star Schema, implementing the physical model in MySQL, and using ETL processes to integrate data into the Data Warehouse. I also designed interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize key performance indicators. The project automated reporting, enhanced sales performance analysis, and identified opportunities for business expansion, improving the companyâ€™s decision-making process.
